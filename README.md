Recreating chess with an engine that can beat me, but that's not that big of an accomplishment

4/17/23 Update: So far, have finished most of the game rule implementation, still missing castling and checks.
                Code is messy and redundant in parts, will need to add more recursive functions and add documentation.
                Graphics interface is coming along, still have to combine functionality so pieces behave properly.
                Engine is still a WIP as well, have been busy finishing up other projects, had to leave this one on the backburner,
                but will begin maining this project again within the week.
